Summary:

SOFA demoed at final FAST all-hands meeting on 1 November.  (One of the better all-hands meetings?)

Not much progress in other areas due to focus on meeting.

# Progress review: proposed Agenda

1. Agenda bashing; set date next meeting

Next meeting: 2019-11-12 10:00 @@later

2. Review actions

3. Review milestones

4. TW review: last period

(GFK will catch-up tomorrow, 2019-11-13)

5. JP review: last period, next actions, blockers

6. GK review: last period, next actions, blockers


# Actions brought forward

ACTION: JP Merge SOFA state-save/restore changes to master branch.

- progress but problems with VMs; problems running Solid in Docker Script; currently copying existing image instead.  Can't run locally because of laptop problems, so dependent on remote machines.


# Current goals/milestones

Expect no more meaningful developmemnt after this month?


# TW review

- No report: expecting to catch up on Wednesday

## Previously

## Next steps

- Key distribution per song agent

- Key typicality agent

See: [MELD/CALMA agents and annotation models](https://github.com/oerc-music/meld-calma/blob/master/notes/meld-calma-agents-and-annotation-models.md)

## Blockers

- (unknown)


# JPNP review

## Previous

SOFA demo at all-hands meeting.  Seemed to come off.  Not much call for architecture discussion.

@@TODO

<!--
TODO:

- Create new set of fragments for demo using Mat's generator code.  In a form ready to be uploaded to workset container (with script to do so).  Some work on done to create fragments, but not yet the dataset creation.

- Duration match problem reported:  not yet progressed.  Possible a fragment display problem?
-->

## Next

@@TODO

<!--
- More testing (esp. save/load)

- Finish work on command line tool for fragment set merging - probably after next meeting. NOT urgent for 1 Nov demo.

This will complete the planned SOFA updates.

- Improve support for triggering agent runs - aiming for some kind of framework that can handle running multiple agents, as needed (e.g. in response to container data changes).  Anticipate some kind of pub-sub mechanism to re-run computations when container changes, or in response to other triggers.
    - Note GK activity on Solid notifications
-->


## Blockers

- Still(!) awaiting repair of failed laptop; workarounds used are slowing progress.

(IT support had failed to ship: estimate lost £160 on life of laptop alone, let alone opportunity cost.)

## Overall plan/roadmap

- CALMA server backups (TW to supply a backup disk) (DONE!)

- Finish off outstanding items for SOFA 
    - https://github.com/oerc-music/nin-remixer-public/blob/master/notes/meetings/2019-03-26-meeting.md

    - complete testing of changes for load/save, then push to GitHub
        - not yet in running version (ongoing)

    - command line tooling to merge fragment sets [JP6], (as update to MELD CLI tools [GK5])

    - Finish off MEI output
        - for later

- Agent-run triggering.


# GK review

## Previously

- Reviewed progress with TW at all hands (not much, due to meeting prep, etc.); arranged meeting for 2019-11-13 to progress agents, hopefully get close to some conclusion.

- Very little other progress (no time)


## Next

- update test case for song-to-signal agent based on outcomes of meeting with Thomas (see notes in `src/agents/test-song-to-signal.sh`).

- continue with refactoring:  start using (and testing) shared functions in song-to-signal agent

Aim to catch up and review progress at the FAST wrap-up meeting on 1 Nov 2019.

- Create tests for other agents as they come available.

- Look at incorporating agent-triggering logic into tests so that agents don't need to be run manually.  (This willl be after JPNP has finished SOFA updates.)

## Blockers

- Waiting for JPNP completion of SOFA updates, and specifically starting to look at agent-run triggering.

## Overall plan / roadmap

### Done

- Add support for WebSocket notifications to meld-tool.js (done)

- meld-tool options to use WebSocket notifications from Solid (done)

- Complete test for song-to-signal agent (done)

- Test for number-of-occurrences agent (done)

- Test for key/recording duration agent (done)

- Meet with Johan when we’ve settled our data model for feature data (scheduled for 2019-10-08) (Done)

### To do

- Test for key/song duration agent

- Look at incorporating agent-triggering logic into tests to that agents don't need to be run manually.  (Awaiting work from JPNP)

- Add features to meld-cli-tool as they may be required
