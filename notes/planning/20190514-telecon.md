# TW review

## Previous

PLAN:

- Finish off getting Solid server running.
    - Has Solid server running

- Think about getting actual CALMA features.
    - some investigation; no actual implementation yet
    - may need some discussion of implementation
    - (need to agree: what to extract, data model, then implement)

- Review/test JP script changes when available.
    - blocked

## Next

- look at MELD-tool scripts;  plan to discuss with GK after this meeting (start in email)
    - See also: https://github.com/oerc-music/meld-cli-tools/tree/master/src/meld-tool/tests

## Blockers

- No blockers.  May need input from us as investigations proceed.


# JPNP review

## Previous

PLAN:

- Finish up Solid dockerization documentation
    - progress with Solid install issues; 
    - Docker is now running and needs some manual configuration
    - (Deployed on Thalassa; wanted for LD and musicology course in June)
    - Needs some stress-testing.
    - Documentation is no longer urgent

- Continue updates to TW scripts to write data to LDP container.  Should complete initial track-to-work linkage agent.
    - Some progress, but not yet completed;
    - Will notify Thomas as soon as something is working.
    - Est half day to go

- Start thinking about generating repeatable FRBR musical work URIs from artist+title data provided by TW.  E.g. allocate random URIs for new works, but when dealing with artist+track title, lookup first before allocating a new URI.
    - not yet started

## Next

- Finish off TW script updates, and circulate links.  Update copy in GitHub.
- Deploy Solid+SOFA to VMs (for other projects)
- Start thinking about generating repeatable FRBR musical work URIs from artist+title data provided by TW.  E.g. allocate random URIs for new works, but when dealing with artist+track title, lookup first before allocating a new URI.
- Investigate how agents can be automatically triggered:  is this important?
    - GK thoughts: use polling with HTTP if-changed?  Can Solid provide async triggers?

## Blockers

- No blockers.


# GK review

## Previous

- Discussion with JP about Solid deploment in Docker.  Tracked down initial registration problem (needs WebId enabled).  Emailed Thgomas with detaiuls, as it sounded like his problem too.  Updated notes.
- No progress on testing framework for data created at the interface between CALMA/etree exports and SOFA agents.

## Next

- Post Solid issue on LDP setup and registration
- Create initial testing framework for data created at the interface between CALMA/etree exports and SOFA agents
- Add features to meld-cli-tool as they may be required
- Possible medl-cli-tool refactoring

## Blockers

- testing framework: awaiting initial agent implementation writing to LDP from JP/TW
