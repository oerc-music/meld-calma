PLAN:

- Finish up Solid dockerization documentation.
- Continue updates to TW scripts to write data to LDP container.  Should complete initial track-to-work linkage agent.
- Start thinking about generating repeatable FRBR musical work URIs from artist+title data provided by TW.  E.g. allocate random URIs for new works, but when dealing with artist+track title, lookup first before allocating a new URI.
