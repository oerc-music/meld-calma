# TW review

## Previous

<!--
Write various scripts to get a feel for the data model, etc.  Created simple annotations connecting a word to an etree track, and a simple LDP basic container structure for each artist.

Did this for all songs in etree to see how big it would be.  Looks like about 500Mb as Turtle?

(JP: initially, probably want to focus on a single artist.)

Coded in Python.
-->

Will push scripts to GitHub in demoable form.

Limit output to data present in CALMA.

Set up LDP/Solid Docker container.  (JP will send instructions.)

Script to push annotations into the container.

With main goal of gaining familiarity with getting annotations into an LDP container.
