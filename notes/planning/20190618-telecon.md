# TW review

<!--
Continue with agents; upload some initial code to GitHub (by end of week).

Take note of data model notes from last meeting, now in [MELD/CALMA agents and annotation models](https://github.com/oerc-music/meld-calma/blob/master/notes/meld-calma-agents-and-annotation-models.md))

## Next steps


## Blockers

None at present.


# JPNP review

## Plan/roadmap

- CALMA server backups (TW to supply a backup disk)

- Finish off outstanding items for SOFA 
    - https://github.com/oerc-music/nin-remixer-public/blob/master/notes/meetings/2019-03-26-meeting.md

    - complete testing of changes for load/save, then push to GitHub
        - not yet in running version

    - demo setup improvements **DONE**
        - pull Mat's changes into docker image for NiN (including add HOWTO in documentation)
        - test NiN data auto-generation
        - generate larger test data set, and incorporate that into demo setup
            - have a better dataset; in demo setup
            - would still like to have a larger dataset (e.g. 100 more fragments)

    - command line tooling to merge fragment sets [JP6], (as update to MELD CLI tools [GK5])
        - held for some pair activity with GK on meld-tool

    - Finish off MEI output
        - for later

## Previous

<!--
- recursive remove in meld tool - pair-work with GK (as meld-tool learning exercise)
- finish load/save functionality in SOFA, and incorporate into deployed system

# GK review

## Previous

Session with JPNP to add recursive-remove logic to meld-tool.

Wrapped up some details of meld-tool receursive-remove; created test.

Extracted some planning documents from these meeting notes.
- [MELD/CALMA agents and annotation models](https://github.com/oerc-music/meld-calma/blob/master/notes/meld-calma-agents-and-annotation-models.md)
- [Future features](https://github.com/oerc-music/meld-calma/blob/master/notes/future-features.md)

## Next/plan

- meld-tool refactoring 
- Create initial testing framework for data created at the interface between CALMA/etree exports and SOFA agents
    - No progress; intend to base on stabilized results of TW agents
- Add features to meld-cli-tool as they may be required
- Planning to meet with Johan when weâ€™ve settled our data model for feature data (not scheduled yet)
- Look at Solid notifications via WebSockets; also node.js websockets library
- Think about meld-tool options to use this

## Blockers

- Awaiting stabilized agent from TW, to use as basis for initial test code.  (I'm hoping to use this as a basis for discussion with JP; e.g. to use the framework to map out some test cases for a TDD approach?)
