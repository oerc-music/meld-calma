# Progress review: proposed Agenda

1. Agenda bashing; set date next meeting

Next telecon: 2019-06-25 at 10:00 (we have FAST meeting 11:00)

2. Review actions

3. TW review: last period, next actions, blockers

4. JP review: last period, next actions, blockers

5. GK review: last period, next actions, blockers


# Actions brought forward

(These were not reviewed, so carried forward)

ACTION TW: supply backup disk for CALMA data (ongoing: Thomas to chase)

ACTION TW: song-to-signal agent running against the etree data (ongoing: updates per 2019-06-18 meeting)

ACTION GK: test case for song-to-signal agent writing to LDP


# TW review

Made some progress, some things need clarification...

Song-to-signal agent has all versions of one Mogwai song (Acid food) in a local Solid server.  work_annotations/song-to-signal.py Works for one artist/song combination.

Work on key typicality: see key_typicality.py (not yet in GitHub)


## Next steps

- Re-work song-to-signal agent to reflect structures in [MELD/CALMA agents and annotation models](https://github.com/oerc-music/meld-calma/blob/master/notes/meld-calma-agents-and-annotation-models.md)

- Re-work key/song duration agent to reuse output of song-to-signal agent


## Blockers

None at present.


# JPNP review

## Plan/roadmap

- CALMA server backups (TW to supply a backup disk)

- Finish off outstanding items for SOFA 
    - https://github.com/oerc-music/nin-remixer-public/blob/master/notes/meetings/2019-03-26-meeting.md

    - complete testing of changes for load/save, then push to GitHub
        - not yet in running version

    - demo setup improvements **DONE**
        - pull Mat's changes into docker image for NiN (including add HOWTO in documentation)
        - test NiN data auto-generation
        - generate larger test data set, and incorporate that into demo setup
            - have a better dataset; in demo setup
            - would still like to have a larger dataset (e.g. 100 more fragments)

    - command line tooling to merge fragment sets [JP6], (as update to MELD CLI tools [GK5])
        - held for some pair activity with GK on meld-tool

    - Finish off MEI output
        - for later

## Previous

Recursive remove in meld tool - pair-work with GK (as meld-tool learning exercise) (DONE)

Finish load/save functionality in SOFA, and incorporate into deployed system (Ongoing)

Making changes to remixer processes to do load/save as previously discussed (see [20181127-maintaining-sofa-state-as-dmo.md](https://github.com/oerc-music/nin-remixer-public/blob/master/notes/20181127-maintaining-sofa-state-as-dmo.md)), using async I/O instead of using internal state, but still need to do the actual read/write of state.

## Next

- Remixer state I/O functions

- Improve support for running agents - aiming for some kind of framework that can handle running multiple agents, as needed (e.g. in response to container data changes).  Anticipate some kind of pub-sub mechanism to re-run computations when container changes, or in response to other triggers.


## Blockers

(None at present)


# GK review

## Previous

Session with JPNP to add recursive-remove logic to meld-tool.

Wrapped up some details of meld-tool receursive-remove; created test.

Extracted some planning documents from these meeting notes.
- [MELD/CALMA agents and annotation models](https://github.com/oerc-music/meld-calma/blob/master/notes/meld-calma-agents-and-annotation-models.md)
- [Future features](https://github.com/oerc-music/meld-calma/blob/master/notes/future-features.md)

## Next/plan

- meld-tool refactoring 
    - NOTE: (JPNP) React transpiler can handle node-style modules.
- Look at Solid notifications via WebSockets; also node.js websockets library
- Think about meld-tool options to use this
- Create initial testing framework for data created at the interface between CALMA/etree exports and SOFA agents
    - No progress; intend to base on stabilized results of TW agents
- Add features to meld-cli-tool as they may be required
- Planning to meet with Johan when weâ€™ve settled our data model for feature data (not scheduled yet)

## Blockers

- Awaiting stabilized agent from TW, to use as basis for initial test code.  (I'm hoping to use this as a basis for discussion with JP; e.g. to use the framework to map out some test cases for a TDD approach?)
