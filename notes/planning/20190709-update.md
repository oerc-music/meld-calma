The [MELD/CALMA agents and annotation models](https://github.com/oerc-music/meld-calma/blob/master/notes/meld-calma-agents-and-annotation-models.md) has been updated following today's diuscussions, mainly to clarify some details and flesh out some details.


# Progress review: proposed Agenda

1. Agenda bashing; set date next meeting

Next telecon: (tentatively) 2019-07-16 at 10:00 (TBC)

2. Review actions

3. TW review: last period, next actions, blockers

4. JP review: last period, next actions, blockers

5. GK review: last period, next actions, blockers

6. Tech discussions / matters arising


# Actions brought forward

ACTION TW: supply backup disk for CALMA data (ongoing: Thomas to chase)
    - will try to ship to us, but if that's administratively challenging then keep it locally until we can arrange collection or delivery.
    - question about capacity: at least 3Tb (asked for 4Tb?)

ACTION TW: song-to-signal agent running against the etree data (ongoing)
    - almost complete, but some annotation instance URIs need to be changed to be resolvable

ACTION GK: test case for song-to-signal agent writing to LDP (awaiting TW song-to-signal agent)


# TW review

<!--
- Finish up work on song-to-signal agent to reflect structures in [MELD/CALMA agents and annotation models](https://github.com/oerc-music/meld-calma/blob/master/notes/meld-calma-agents-and-annotation-models.md)

- Re-work key/song duration agent to reuse output of song-to-signal agent

# JPNP review

## Previous

<!--
- Hopeful of completing remixer state I/O functions

- ?? Improve support for running agents - aiming for some kind of framework that can handle running multiple agents, as needed (e.g. in response to container data changes).  Anticipate some kind of pub-sub mechanism to re-run computations when container changes, or in response to other triggers.
    - Note GK activity on Solid notifications

## Overrall plan/roadmap

- CALMA server backups (TW to supply a backup disk)

- Finish off outstanding items for SOFA 
    - https://github.com/oerc-music/nin-remixer-public/blob/master/notes/meetings/2019-03-26-meeting.md

    - complete testing of changes for load/save, then push to GitHub
        - not yet in running version

    - command line tooling to merge fragment sets [JP6], (as update to MELD CLI tools [GK5])

    - Finish off MEI output
        - for later


# GK review

## Last week

- created (and tested) some experimental nodejs code for testing WebSockets notifications, in preparation for adding Solid notification detection/response capabilities to meld-tool.

Design notes at:

https://github.com/oerc-music/meld-calma/blob/master/notes/20190702-notifications.md

Code, modeled on meld-tool, at:

https://github.com/oerc-music/meld-cli-tools/blob/master/src/meld-tool/ws_tool_cli.js

(I wrote, but didn't test, an experimental function to provide the websocket notification via a Promise.  I haven't pursued this yet, as I need to figure out how to handle the timeout / incoming message cases via a promise.)

## Next

Meeting with Thomas in Oxford on 2019-07-09 to make a push on sorting out the Solid/SOFA interfaces for the MELD/CALMA feature extraction agents.  I plan to develop some test code alongside the agent development, which is an outstanding ACTION on me.

If time permits, I'll also start to look at adding Solid notification handling code to meld-tool.

## Blockers

- Awaiting stabilized agent(s) from TW, to use as basis for initial test code. This should get unblocked this week.

## Overall plan / roadmap

- Add support for WebSocket notifications to meld-tool.js (done - see above)

- meld-tool options to use WebSocket notifications from Solid (in progress - see above)

- Create initial testing framework for data created at the interface between CALMA/etree exports and SOFA agents (awaiting agent code - plan to progress this week - see above)

- Add features to meld-cli-tool as they may be required

- Possible meet with Johan when weâ€™ve settled our data model for feature data (not scheduled yet)

# Other

TW to visit Oxford Wednesday 10 July to make a push on completing and testing of agents.

(TW on FAST until end Oct)

Discussion mainly between TW and GK, to discuss TW questions about the folder/data model.

Noted that artist, song and annotation URIs in the RDF data should be dereferencable URLs rather than allocated identifiers.

Noted that the "Key distribution per recording agent" is effectively recording provenance of the Sonic Annotator data, which is a quite complex.  The main results used within this application are the key identifier and prevelance values.

The inclusion of transform info - vamp plugin, parameters, etc - was previously recorded against the wrong agent - should have been "Key distribution per recording", not "Key distribution per song"

After this meeting, based on our discussions, GK updated the [MELD/CALMA agents and annotation models](https://github.com/oerc-music/meld-calma/blob/master/notes/meld-calma-agents-and-annotation-models.md)  document.
