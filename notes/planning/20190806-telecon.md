# Progress review: proposed Agenda

1. Agenda bashing; set date next meeting

Next telecon: (????)  
(GK away until 2019-09-09)

2. Review actions

3. TW review: last period, next actions, blockers

4. JP review: last period, next actions, blockers

5. GK review: last period, next actions, blockers

6. Tech discussions / matters arising


# Actions brought forward

ACTION TW: supply backup disk for CALMA data (ongoing)_
- "The hard drive for the CALMA backup is confirmed and should be on its way directly to oerc (attn. John). "
- waiting for JP to confirm receipt/pass to Kevin

ACTION GK: test case for song-to-signal agent writing to LDP. DONE
- A basic set of tests is running.
- It's not totally automatic, in that the agent needs to be run separately by hand.
- Still to do is testing the song-to-signal annotations.
- See: https://github.com/oerc-music/meld-calma/blob/master/src/agents/song-to-signal/test-song-to-signal.sh

ACTION: JP Investigate and report status of numbers-into-notes fragment set merging 
(DONE - activity is now started).

NEW ACTION: JP Merge SOFA state-save/restore changes to master branch.


# TW review

<!--
I continued working on the key/song duration agent, there’s still some things to do. I spent a bit too much time on fixing the issue of creating duplicate entries on the server, but I decided to leave it as is for now to focus on the key/song duration, so that we can continue with the work. The data model is used as discussed and described in  https://github.com/oerc-music/meld-calma/blob/master/notes/meld-calma-agents-and-annotation-models.md. I hope to upload the new agent at the weekend.
-->

<!--
- Continue re-work of key/song duration agent to reuse output of song-to-signal agent
-->

## Next steps

## Blockers

- None mentioned

# JPNP review

## Previous

<!--
- Remixer state I/O functions are implemented, seems to be working.  Not yet merged to master.

    (Had to make changes to the grid structure in the state data in the browser, to allow each cell to reference its resource in the state representation container to facilitate update.  By replacing a URI with a JS object, it should now be easier to implement generic grid structures; e.g. for meld/calma.)

    ACTION: merge changes to master branch.

- Started work on command line tool for fragment set merging.
-->

<!--
- Finish work on command line tool for fragment set merging.  This will complete the planned SOFA updates.

- Improve support for triggering agent runs - aiming for some kind of framework that can handle running multiple agents, as needed (e.g. in response to container data changes).  Anticipate some kind of pub-sub mechanism to re-run computations when container changes, or in response to other triggers.
    - Note GK activity on Solid notifications
-->

## Next

## Blockers

(None)

## Overall plan/roadmap

- CALMA server backups (TW to supply a backup disk)

- Finish off outstanding items for SOFA 
    - https://github.com/oerc-music/nin-remixer-public/blob/master/notes/meetings/2019-03-26-meeting.md

    - complete testing of changes for load/save, then push to GitHub
        - not yet in running version (ongoing)

    - command line tooling to merge fragment sets [JP6], (as update to MELD CLI tools [GK5])

    - Finish off MEI output
        - for later


# GK review

## Last week

- added song-to-signal agent annotation test
    - See https://github.com/oerc-music/meld-calma/blob/master/src/agents/song-to-signal/test-song-to-signal.sh

## Next

- start creating tests for key/song duration agent

- look at incorporating agent-triggering logic into tests to that agents don't need to be run manually.

(Don't expect much progress here until well into September)

## Blockers

(None)

## Overall plan / roadmap

- Add support for WebSocket notifications to meld-tool.js (done)

- meld-tool options to use WebSocket notifications from Solid (done)

- Complete tests for song-to-signal agent (done)

- Tests for key/song duration agent

- look at incorporating agent-triggering logic into tests to that agents don't need to be run manually.

- Add features to meld-cli-tool as they may be required

- Possible meet with Johan when we’ve settled our data model for feature data (not scheduled yet)
