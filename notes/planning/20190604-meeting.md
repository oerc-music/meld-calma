4. JP review: last period, next actions, blockers

5. GK review: last period, next actions, blockers


# Actions brought forward

ACTION TW: bring backup disk for CALMA to 4 June meeting

ACTION JP: update TW's script to write to LDP (this was mostly completed during the last meeting, but still needs to be run against the etree data)

ACTION JP: send solid server details to TW (Docker-based + README) (I got the impression this was now done.  JP?)

ACTION GK: (maybe later) test case for script writing to LDP (now unblocked?)


# TW review

## Previous

Plan:

- push ahead with song-to-signal agent.

- Think about getting actual CALMA features.
    - some investigation performed; no actual implementation yet
    - (need to agree: what to extract, data model, then implement)

## Next

## Blockers

- No blockers.  May need input from JP/GK as development proceeds.


# JPNP review

## Previous

PLAN:

- Finish up Solid dockerization documentation
    - progress with Solid install issues; 
    - improved initial Solid configuration mnechanisms
    - docmentation?

- Finish off outsanding items for SOFA 
    - https://github.com/oerc-music/nin-remixer-public/blob/master/notes/meetings/2019-03-26-meeting.md
- Investigate how agents can be automatically triggered:  is this important?
    - GK thoughts: use polling with HTTP if-changed?  Can Solid provide async triggers?
- CALMA server backups (TW should be bringing a backup disk on 4 June)

## Next

## Blockers

- No blockers.


# GK review

## Previous/plan

- Help TW as required with LDP and meld-cli-tool investigations
    - No contact

- Create initial testing framework for data created at the interface between CALMA/etree exports and SOFA agents
    - No progress - am kind-of waiting for agent to be complete

- Plan to design other agents on 4 June?
    - Identify agents
    - Design data models to be created
    - Design test data and procedure

- Add features to meld-cli-tool as they may be required
    - Nothing raised

- Possible medl-cli-tool refactoring
    - No activity

## Next

## Blockers

- Not strictly a blocker, but waiting for initial agent implementation to create initial test suite; e.g. how to actually run the agent withion a test setup?
