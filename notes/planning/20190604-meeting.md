# Agent software using Solid

A basic agent is working that writes data to a Solid server:
https://github.com/oerc-music/meld-calma/blob/master/src/work_annotations/song-to-signal.py

This raised many questions about datya models, which we spent much the day discussing.  Preliminbary notes from those discussions are below.


# Data modelling

## Connecting recordings to works

# Progress review: proposed Agenda

1. Agenda bashing; set date next meeting

Next telecon: 2019-06-12 at 10:00

2. Review actions

3. TW review: last period, next actions, blockers

4. JP review: last period, next actions, blockers

5. GK review: last period, next actions, blockers

6. Review Thomas's agent

E.g.,

    python song-to-singal.py Mogwai "Acid Food"

Env CONTAINER has URI of Solid container, defaults to https://localhost:8443/public/

Question: is there a way to SPARQL-query for case-insensitive song titles?

    1. pull all titles for artist, and use SPARQL filters
    2. Etree uses Virtuoso, which may have a text search option

Question: how to test if an entry already exists?


# Actions brought forward

ACTION TW: bring backup disk for CALMA to 4 June meeting

ACTION JP: update TW's script to write to LDP (this was mostly completed during the last meeting, but still needs to be run against the etree data)

ACTION JP: send solid server details to TW (Docker-based + README) (I got the impression this was now done.  JP?)

ACTION GK: (maybe later) test case for script writing to LDP (now unblocked?)


# TW review

## Previous

- push ahead with song-to-signal agent.
    - have something; will review in this meeting
    - 

- reviewed John's code from last meeting, used that pattern

- Think about getting actual CALMA features.
    - some investigation performed; no actual implementation yet
    - (need to agree: what to extract, data model, then implement)
    - Some thoughts, no details yet.  Plan to discuss architecture today

- CALMA backup disk?
    - delayed on getting approval
    - will send the disk when available

## Next

- review agent code (today)

- discuss CALMA feature extraction

- continue with what is started


## Blockers

- No blockers.  May need input from JP/GK as development proceeds.


# JPNP review

## Plan/roadmap

- Finish up Solid dockerization documentation (***DONE***)
    - See: https://github.com/oerc-music/sofa-docker (README - script is tested)
    - (Documentation formatting could be tidied upo a little)
    - (Installed with Uni cert, but process for setting up is not yet documented in README)

- Investigate how agents can be automatically triggered:  is this important?
    - SOme inverstigation: Solid offers update notifications via a WebSockets interface
    - No development activity yet

- CALMA server backups (TW should be bringing a backup disk on 4 June)

- Finish off outsanding items for SOFA 
    - https://github.com/oerc-music/nin-remixer-public/blob/master/notes/meetings/2019-03-26-meeting.md

    - complete testing of changes for load/save, then push to GitHub
        - not yet in running version

    - demo setup improvements
        - pull Mat's changes into docker image for NiN (including add HOWTO in documentation)
        - test NiN data auto-generation
        - generate larger test data set, and incorporate that into demo setup
            - have a better dataset; in demo setup
            - would still like to have a larger dataset (e.g. 100 more fragments)

    - command line tooling to merge fragment sets [JP6], (as update to MELD CLI tools [GK5])
        - held for some pair activity with GK on meld-tool

    - Finish off MEI output
        - for later

## Previous

Much time spent setting stuff up for David Lewis' training course.  Using Solid interface to tweak data.  Needed to add "refresh" button to re-run the match agents.  Regenerated 20 sets of data in a Solid server (fragments and fragment references, etc.).  Beefed up virtual machine capacity, was able to scale up agent activity.

Wrote node tool for recursive delete.  Maybe plan pair-programmiung session to incorporate this into meld-tool.

Tweaks to SOFA interface to expose more URIs (e.g. fragment URIs).

Have more useful collection of fragments.

(GK: it occurs to me that once the SOFA app is settled, we could start looking at optimizations for performance of the agent model.  Maybe also follow up links with Inrupt delelopment of an enterprise frade Solid server andtry that for performance?)

## Next

Refocus on original SOFA plan.

Mainly:

- hacking on MELD tool

- demo setup improvements


## Blockers

- Pair work with GK on meld-tool


# GK review

## Previous/plan

- Help TW as required with LDP and meld-cli-tool investigations
    - No contact

- Create initial testing framework for data created at the interface between CALMA/etree exports and SOFA agents
    - No progress - am kind-of waiting for agent to be complete

- Plan to design other agents on 4 June?
    - Identify agents
    - Design data models to be created
    - Design test data and procedure

- Add features to meld-cli-tool as they may be required
    - Nothing raised

- Possible medl-cli-tool refactoring
    - No activity

## Next

- Look at Solid notifications via WebSockets; also node.js websockets library
- Think aboiut meld-tool options to use this

## Blockers

- Not strictly a blocker, but waiting for initial agent implementation to create initial test suite; e.g. how to actually run the agent withion a test setup?


# Song-to-signal agent

We reviewed the data model, and concluded that we need spome additional structure to allow us to associate artist resources with artist names.

Proposed, then, is something like:

    /public

      /artists_songs
        /Mogwai_xyz
          /song_xyz.ttl
            <> a mc:Song (?) ;
              rdfs:label "Acid Food by Mogwai" ;
              mc:song_name "Acid Food" ;
              mc:artist_name "Mogwai" ;
              .
         :

      /song_to_recording
        /song_annotation_xyz.ttl
          <> a oa:Annotation ;
            oa:motivatedBy mc:SONG_TO_RECORDING ;
            oa:hasTarget <song_xyz.ttl>
            oa:hasBody <etree_recording_id>
            .

      /artist_name_to_id
        /artist_annotation_xyz.ttl
          <> a oa:Annotation ;
            oa:motivatedBy mc:ARTIST_ID_NAME ;
            oa:hasTarget <...artists_songs/Mogwai_xyz>
            oa:hasBody   [ mc:artist_name "Mogwai" ]    <-- body is bnode; could (should?) have URI
            .

And maybe later...

      /song_name_to_id
        /song_annotation_xyz.ttl
          <> a oa:Annotation ;
            oa:motivatedBy mc:SONG_ID_NAME ;
            oa:hasTarget <...artists_songs/Mogwai_xyz/song_xyz.ttl...> or "song reference" (see below)
            oa:hasBody   [ mc:song_name "Acid Food", "acid food", "AcidFood", etc. ]
            .

Note that the structure of container names here is illustrative: agents and clients should discover container references by following indexes rather than knowledge of the naming structure used.

Otherwise, there seems to have been good progress on the agent, with data extracted from CALMA being written to contaimners on a Solid server, though some design decisions still need to be finalized.

We discussed introducing the notion of a "song reference" as a way to populate worksets of songs (see below).  (See also "fragment reference": https://thalassa2.oerc.ox.ac.uk:4443/public/DEMO/FragRef-009362d3-45d3-469b-be15-c4646f335525.ttl)


# Further discussion / TODO

General discussion of architecture and software designs.  None of these topics led directly to actionable decisions, but they helped to establish consensus about some design ideas and principles for further developments.

- [x] bigger picture and directions for remixer
    - (see whiteboard image)

- [x] architecture for accessing CALMA features

    - notes from 2018-07-30 meeting last year
        - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JTr5Q7lf6wh-vMsCQvGpG-CXlWjdciaprHjyB5fYA-4/edit

    - Example for querying data on Solid server

- [x] Skeleton and support library for new agents

- [x] Need to think more about annotation container discovery

    - Propose to maintain a "feature index" container that keeps a record of annotation containers associated with a workset

- [x] Annotation containers should include a reference to the workset to which they apply, and an indication of the "motivation" of the contained annotations, and an maybe indication of what agent created it?


# Further agents

We discussed what further agents will be needed, and data models for the annotations they would create.

![MELD/CALMA music flows](images/20190604-MELD-CALMA-flows.jpg)


## Number of occurrences agent

Create a container of annotations that target songs, and record a count of recordings available for each song.

    /public

      /song_number_of_occurrences
        /anno_song_xyz.ttl
          <> a oa:Annotation ;
            oa:motivatedBy mc:SONG_NUM_RECORDINGS ;
            oa:hasTarget <song_xyz> ;
            oa:hasBody   [ mc:number_of_recordings "n" ] ;
            .

### Annotation container index details

@@TODO.  See also "workset_feature_index" below?

The intent here is that a specified or directly discoverable container will contain references to all other containers referenced directly or indirectly by the various annotation agents and display (remixer) client software.  There should be enough information to allow containers to be located without explicit prior knowledge beyond the general data model schema - the software shoud be able to work with annotation containers (and worksets) stored at arbitrary, distriburted locations.

### Song workset

At some point, we may want to add a notion of a "song workset", which follows the general structure of a SOFA workset, but references songs rather than to fragments.  The members of a song workset could look something like this:

    @prefix ldp:  <http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#>.
    @prefix dc:   <http://purl.org/dc/elements/>.
    @prefix dct:  <http://purl.org/dc/terms/>.
    @prefix meld: <http://example.com/meld/>.         @@@TODO proper namespace URI
    @prefix mc:   <http://example.com/meldedcalma/>.  @@@TODO proper namespace URI
    
    <>
        a mc:SongRef, meld:ItemRef, ldp:Resource;
        dc:creator "John";
        dct:created "2019-06-01T14:09:58+0100";
        meld:ref <artists_songs/Mogwai_xyz/song_xyz.ttl>
        .


## Song selection agent

Uses the number of occurrences annotations to create new worksets containing recordings of songs that satisfy the >=100 recordings criteria.  The "workset feature index" container contains annotation resources that connect "Recording workset containers" (see below) with feature annotation containers that relate to that workset.

    /public

      /recording_workset_container
        /recording_xyz
          <recording reference (see below)>
          :

      /workset_feature_index
        /anno_workset_xyz
          <> a oa:Annotation ;
            oa:motivatedBy mc:WORKSET_FEATURE_INDEX ;
            oa:hasTarget <recording_workset_container>
            oa:hasBody   <workset_feature_container>
            .

A separate "Recording workset container" is created for each song identified in the data.  (Later, the annotations may be extended to allow different songs to be treated as variations of the same Work.)

Any agent that subsequently creates a feature annotation container for a workset should also add an entry for that container 


### Recording workset

We add here a notion of a "recording workset", which follows the structure of a SOFA workset that contains references to CALMA recordings rather than to fragments.  The members of a recording workset container look something like this:

    @prefix ldp:  <http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#>.
    @prefix dc:   <http://purl.org/dc/elements/>.
    @prefix dct:  <http://purl.org/dc/terms/>.
    @prefix meld: <http://example.com/meld/>.         @@@TODO proper namespace URI
    @prefix mc:   <http://example.com/meldedcalma/>.  @@@TODO proper namespace URI
    
    <>
        a mc:RecordingRef, meld:ItemRef, ldp:Resource;
        dc:creator "John";
        dct:created "2019-06-01T14:09:58+0100";
        meld:ref <CALMA recording URI>
        .

The intent is that as each recording is processed by the Song selection agent, its details are stored in the "Recording workset", which can be used to enumerate (or scope) the subsequent activities of annaotation agents and the display (remixer) client.


## Key distribution per recording agent

For a given song-workset (created by Song selection agent), accesses the CALMA data for each recording and writes an annotation for each recording describing the key detection information (containing detected keys and duration within recording).

The resulting annotations would have this general form:

    <> a oa:Annotation ;
      oa:motivatedBy mc:KEY_DISTRIBUTION ;
      oa:hasTarget (recording reference in recording workset)
      oa:hasBody (details @@TBD, based on key disribution data for recording obtained from CALMA)
      .


## Similar occurrences agent

For all recordings, compute an "average" key distribution across all recordings of a given song (workset), and create a per-song annotation recording this.  Then for each recording, calculate a "key typicality" measure that represents deviation from average key distribution of that recording, and create a per-recording annotation for this.

    <> a oa:Annotation ;
      oa:motivatedBy mc:SONG_KEY_PREVALANCE ;
      oa:hasTarget (song reference in song workset)
      oa:hasBody 
        [ mc:key_info 
          [ mc:key_id (key id) ;
            mc:average_prevalence "(fraction)"^(xsd:double)
          ]
        ]
      .

    <> a oa:Annotation ;
      oa:motivatedBy mc:RECORDING_KEY_TYPICALITY ;
      oa:hasTarget (recording reference in recording workset)
      oa:hasBody [ 
          mc:key_typicality "(fraction)"^(xsd:double) ;
          mc:key_info [ 
            mc:key_id (key id) ;
            mc:prevalence "(fraction)"^xsd:double ;
            mc:average_prevalence "(fraction)"^xsd:double ;
          ]
        ]
      .

Also, add a record of the annotation container to a "feature index" container (to allow selection of alternative features for typicality displays).


## SOFA display client

Allow selection of a feature (initially just key typicality) from the "feature index", and read the corresponding typicality annotations and use these to create an appropriate comparative display.
