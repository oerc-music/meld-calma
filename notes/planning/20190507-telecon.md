# TW review

## Previous

(since 2019-04-09)

Pushed scripts to GitHub in demoable form.

Limit output to data present in CALMA (data in etree with feature data in CALMA).  May also need to think about FLAC files referenced by eTree that go missing.  Not currently a big issue.

Set up LDP/Solid Docker container.  (JP will send instructions.)   Have server running, but coming up against some problems

ACTION: send email with details of error, plan catch up Thursday AM


## Next

Finish off getting Solid server running.

Think about getting actual CALMA features.

Review/test JP script changes when available.


## Blockers

Problems with Solid server (404 error in registration)


# JPNP review

## Previous

(since 2019-04-09)

- Lost some time to bank holiday.
- Mostly tidying up dockerization of Solid + documentation.  Ongoing.
- Send Docker LDP (Solid) container + details to TW: need to update documentaion still; otherwise maybe lower priority as TW has made some progress on direct Solid server installation.  But may still be needed for other activities (KP/DL course).
- Started looking at Thomas's CALMA/etree access scripts to write to LDP.  Ongoing.

## Next

- Finish up Solid dockerization documentation.
- Continue updates to TW scripts to write data to LDP container.  Should complete initial track-to-work linkage agent.
- Start thinking about generating repeatable FRBR musical work URIs from artist+title data provided by TW.  E.g. allocate random URIs for new works, but when dealing with artist+track title, lookup first before allocating a new URI.


## Blockers

- No blockers.
