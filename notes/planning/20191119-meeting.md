Summary:

SOFA demoed at final FAST all-hands meeting on 1 November.  (One of the better all-hands meetings?)

Not much progress in other areas due to focus on meeting.

# Progress review: proposed Agenda

1. Agenda bashing; set date next meeting

Next meeting: 2019-12-03 @@TBC

2. Review actions

3. TW review: last period

4. JP review: last period, next actions, blockers

5. GK review: last period, next actions, blockers

6. Generating rCalma display graphics


# Actions brought forward

ACTION: JP Merge SOFA state-save/restore changes to master branch.

- progress but problems using VMs, running Solid in Docker.  Problem with script that builds container; probable dependency problem.  Need lock file specified in build script?

# Current goals/milestones

Expect no more meaningful development after this month?

Complete outstanding SOFA items.  Maybe advance but not full functionality on agent triggering.


# TW review

Meeting with GFK in London on 2019-11-13.  Notes circulated by email, copy bvelow for reference:

## Poster abstract

TW comments

1. Note browser app under future work?

2. Add reference for Solid

3. Also discuss auth/authz? [GK]


## Plan for today

1. Quick review of current status

2.  Work on agents


## Review current status

See:

TODO:

1. TW: Finish off add logic to the Song-to-signal agent to create song- and recording worksets, and update the documentation to reflect this. (cf. https://github.com/oerc-music/meld-calma/blob/master/notes/planning/20191011-meeting.md)

2. TW: Finish Key distribution per recording agent to write annotations to LDP, referencing entries in a recording workset.  (one recording per date)

3. TW: Wrapper to run agent(s) over all recordings of a given song (iterate over recording worksheet)

4. Key distribution per song agent and Key typicality agent: these functions might be combined in a single agent.
    GK: check documentation of input/output required (DONE)

5. GK: update test case for song-to-signal agent

6. GK: continue factoring out common LDP access code to agent library module


## Review of activity

1. Song-to-signal agent now creates a recording workset for a song, referencing recording reference items.

2. GK has been working on a new feature in meld-cli-tool to allow annotations to be located by target, which will then be used to improve some of the test cases.  This is currently incomplete.

3.  Some work on key-distribution-per-recording agent: have added some notes in committed version, but code is still work in progress.


## Next steps

GK: finish off meld-cli-tool annotation selection feature

GK: update song-to-signal test case using updated meld-cli-tool

TW: work on key-distribution-per-recording agent to link to recording reference items rather than directly to etree recordings

TW: key typicality agent


### Next meeting: 2019-11-26

Catch up on meld/calma agent work: discuss any outstanding issues, probably by Skype

Expect to make progress before meeting, use meeting to review and push forward.  Maybe use Skype rather than F2F.


## Previously

## Next steps

- Key distribution per song agent

- Key typicality agent

See: [MELD/CALMA agents and annotation models](https://github.com/oerc-music/meld-calma/blob/master/notes/meld-calma-agents-and-annotation-models.md)

## Blockers

- (unknown)


# JPNP review

## Previous

@@@

## Next

@@@

- More testing (esp. save/load)

- Finish work on command line tool for fragment set merging - probably after next meeting. NOT urgent for 1 Nov demo.

This will complete the planned SOFA updates.

CONFIRMED: will be complete by 2019-11-15.

- Improve support for triggering agent runs - aiming for some kind of framework that can handle running multiple agents, as needed (e.g. in response to container data changes).  Anticipate some kind of pub-sub mechanism to re-run computations when container changes, or in response to other triggers.
    - Note GK activity on Solid notifications

- ??meld/calma presentation updates??  KP says NO

- Agent to produce JPEG of graph from assembled data ...


SEE ALSO:

- http://calma.linkedmusic.org/rcalma.html

- http://calma.linkedmusic.org/

Assume have missed SOFA-style manipulation/selection in web browser.

Minimum viability: plots from above without typicality score.

Suggest: create container of plots (like plots in above link).  But how to get plots?

(DL knows about rCalma process, has minimal time)

(Ask for pointer to R plotting code?)

MVP: command line tool do download plot(s) of key, no typicality calculation - 

(Also, want pieces to make the web tool.)

TODO: container design for plots

TODO: point JP at container design notes working on with Thomas

## Overall plan/roadmap

- CALMA server backups (TW to supply a backup disk) (DONE!)

- Finish off outstanding items for SOFA 
    - https://github.com/oerc-music/nin-remixer-public/blob/master/notes/meetings/2019-03-26-meeting.md

    - complete testing of changes for load/save, then push to GitHub
        - not yet in running version (ongoing)

    - command line tooling to merge fragment sets [JP6], (as update to MELD CLI tools [GK5])

    - Finish off MEI output
        - for later

- Agent-run triggering.


# GK review

Meeting with Thomas inLondon (see above)

DMRN poster abstract submitted


## Previously

- Working session with Thomas inLondon (see above)
- DMRN poster abstract submitted
- Working on CLI tool enhancement to select anotations by targhet.


## Next

- continue working on CLI tool enhancement to select anotations by targhet.

- update test case for song-to-signal agent based on outcomes of meeting with Thomas (see notes in `src/agents/test-song-to-signal.sh`).

- continue with refactoring:  start using (and testing) shared functions in song-to-signal agent

Aim to catch up and review progress at the FAST wrap-up meeting on 1 Nov 2019.

- Create tests for other agents as they come available.

- Look at incorporating agent-triggering logic into tests so that agents don't need to be run manually.  (This willl be after JPNP has finished SOFA updates.)

## Blockers

## Overall plan / roadmap

### Done

- Add support for WebSocket notifications to meld-tool.js (done)

- meld-tool options to use WebSocket notifications from Solid (done)

- Complete test for song-to-signal agent (done)

- Test for number-of-occurrences agent (done)

- Test for key/recording duration agent (done)

- Meet with Johan when weâ€™ve settled our data model for feature data (scheduled for 2019-10-08) (Done)

### To do

- Test for key/song duration agent

- Add features to meld-cli-tool as they may be required

- (if time/progress permits: Look at incorporating agent-triggering logic into tests to that agents don't need to be run manually.  Awaiting work from JPNP)
